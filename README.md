# GPT-Trainer-v2

Trainerv2 is a Python script that trains a  GPT language model. This script was developed solely by Hello Security LLC and Adam Rivers, and is currently in the early stages of development and testing. As such, users should be aware that there may be bugs, errors, or poor performance.

## Functions

The Trainerv2 script includes the following functions:

### Dataset Preparation

`collect_and_preprocess_data(file_path)` - Reads in text data from a file and preprocesses it.

`CustomDataset` - A custom PyTorch dataset class that tokenizes and encodes input text data.

`split_dataset(texts, test_size=0.1)` - Splits the dataset into training and validation subsets.

### Model Configuration

`choose_pretrained_model(model_name="gpt2")` - Returns a tokenizer for the specified pretrained GPT-2 model.

`configure_model(model_name="gpt2", n_gpu=1, lr=5e-5, batch_size=4, num_train_epochs=3)` - Configures the GPT-2 model and sets up training arguments.

`save_configuration(config, training_args, save_path="config.json")` - Saves the configuration to a JSON file.

### Training

`initialize_model(config)` - Initializes the GPT-2 model with the specified configuration.

`setup_training_loop(tokenizer, train_dataset, val_dataset, model, training_args)` - Sets up the training loop with the specified datasets, model, and training arguments.

`train_model(trainer)` - Trains the GPT-2 model using the specified trainer.

### Evaluation

`evaluate_model(trainer)` - Evaluates the GPT-2 model using the specified trainer.

### Usage

`load_finetuned_model(model_name="output")` - Loads a fine-tuned GPT-2 model from a specified directory.

`generate_response(tokenizer, model, input_text, max_length=100)` - Generates a text-based response to a specified input using the specified tokenizer and GPT-2 model.

`integrate_chatgpt_model(tokenizer, model, input_text)` - Integrates the Trainerv2 model by generating a response to a specified input using the specified tokenizer and GPT-2 model.

## How It Works

The Trainerv2 script uses the GPT-2 language model to generate text-based responses to user input. The script first preprocesses text data and splits it into training and validation subsets. The GPT-2 model is then configured and trained using the training dataset, with the validation dataset used to evaluate the model's performance. After training, the fine-tuned GPT-2 model is loaded and integrated with the `integrate_chatgpt_model()` function to generate responses to user input.

## Instructions for Use

To use the Trainerv2 script, follow these instructions:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required packages using pip: `pip install torch transformers scikit-learn`
3. Create a text file with the input data you want to use to train the model. Each line of the file should contain a separate piece of text data.
4. Update the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your input data file.
5. Run the script using Python: `python trainerv2.py`
6. Once the script has finished training the model, you can generate responses to user input using the `integrate_chatgpt_model()` function. Update the `input_text` variable in the script to specify the user input.
